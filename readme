Here are some scripts to automate tests for the data of the Copernicus Data Store.

The goal is not to tests the functionalities of the commands themselves as much as it is to control integrity of data, speed of download and availability of data.

The first tests would be:

- Regular testing of presence of latest data
- Comparison of some datasets with their ancient version to see if they have not been modified
- Measurements of download speed

The idea is then to transfer the results of those tests via email. For future comparison purpose, I am considering adding a database to add the tests.

All questions and suggestions should be sent to gkoenig@mercator-ocean.fr. And of course everything is free to be copied.
