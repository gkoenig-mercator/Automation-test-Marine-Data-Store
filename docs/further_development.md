# Further Development

## Planned Features

- Automated delivery of test results via email notifications  
- More advanced database schema to support historical trend analysis  
- Long-term comparison of dataset quality and availability  

## Vision

The long-term idea is to provide a **reliable, automated monitoring pipeline** for the Copernicus Data Store.  
This would allow users to:

- Track data availability trends  
- Identify recurring download failures  
- Ensure data integrity across updates  
- Share transparent monitoring results with the community
