# Copernicus Marine Data Testing Scripts

This repository contains automated testing scripts designed to monitor and verify the quality and availability of data from the Copernicus Data Store.

## Purpose

The primary focus of these tests is **not** to validate the functionalities of the Copernicus Marine Toolbox commands themselves, but rather to:

- Ensure the **integrity** of the datasets  
- Monitor the **download speed**  
- Verify the **availability** of the latest data

## Current Tests

The initial suite of tests includes:

- Regular checks for the presence of the most recent datasets  
- Comparison between current and historical datasets to detect unintended modifications  
- Measurement and logging of data download speeds  

## Feedback and Contributions

Your questions, feedback, and suggestions are highly welcome! Please reach out to:

Feel free to use, modify, and share these scripts under an open, collaborative spirit.
